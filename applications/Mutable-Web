# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Mutable Web
- **Team Name:** Dapplets project
- **Payment Address:** NEEDS TO BE FILLED
- **[Level]:** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Mutable Web is a decentralized, community-driven, legacy-compatible web3

### Overview

**Project description**
We have created a platform that enables the development, launch, and delivery of dApps that seamlessly run on top of any websites, embedding into the UX without having to get permission from the owners of those websites.

Any point on the web can be defined, attributed, and used as a source for a web3 action (transaction, tokenization, service delivery). We provide a tokenized persistence layer for this to be true.

We aim to target web3 projects that benefit from addressing their users from familiar UI of popular social networks (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, Github, Youtube) by giving them new functionality.

Our platform provides opportunities and tools for the emergence of a large variant of network effects, and new business cases and aims to motivate the community, users, and web3 developers to become early adopters of the concept and promote it to the masses.

The two main elements of the Mutable Web are the environment for running applications - the browser extension that handles the delivery of applications to sites and the user. And the applications developed by third-party developers.

Currently, we have launched an MVP extension and are in the process of creating meaningful applications that will populate the first platform adopters and onboard app developers. We want to launch several small applications by turning some of the templates offered by Mintbase into comprehensible products and open the possibility for other developers to launch similar products on our platform.

Our plans to launch 3 apps, viz:

- NFT Sales Facilitator - a widget that any user can add to an existing social media post, allowing them to receive a commission through the Affiliation Direct program on a successful purchase.

- NFT illustrator widget - a user can "decorate" any social media post with an AI-generated image based on the content of the post with some added context.

- Alternative Feed widget - user can start a thread with comments based on the NFT contract under any social media post, setting their own rules for participation.

**Relation to NEAR Ecosystem / Integration into the Mintbase**
We use NEAR BOS at the very core of our project. The extension is a customized BOS-vm that allows you to download BOS components and embed them anywhere on an already existing page enriching it with web3 functionality.

Also running a separate fork of Near.Social that provides the same functionality on top of a site built entirely on BOS.
We also delivered the tool to create verifiable mappings between web2 accounts and NEAR addresses to bring new users into the ecosystem.

In using Mintbase, we see great potential to create small but useful applications that will add new NFT-based functionality to users in their usual habitats (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Github).

**Team's Interest in the Project**
The team's efforts are now fully focused on getting the first users and creating positive traction within the NEAR ecosystem to become one of the key projects giving BOS meaning to a wide audience of users and developers.
To achieve this goal and test our hypotheses, we participated in 4 NEAR hackathons and won 1st prizes in each of them, as well as passed the accelerator organized by Encode and Near Horizon

Technology Stack:

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
We believe that our solution will lead to the following results:

It will be several full-fledged applications utilizing Mintbase that will allow users to get new, previously unavailable functionality and get acquainted with the new concept of Mutable Web. We will use the marketing resources available to us to publicize these applications within the NEAR ecosystem and organize the onboarding of new users outside the system. BOS will be used as the front end of applications, so there will be a set of components that will create new patterns of using Mintbase API and based on which you can run your applications within the social networks we support.

The idea of the whole project is to enable the development of applications based on a new distribution principle, and we believe that Mintbase should be one of the main technologies that are responsible for the creation, processing, and storage of tokenized data and we want to simplify the use of technology to remove the friction from developers.

**Who is your target audience?**
Our main focus is on blockchain developers, specifically those engaged in the NEAR ecosystem, mostly developers creating decentralized applications. In addition, we plan to target the broader blockchain community as well, to whom we want to provide a meaningful new way to bring their functionality to users in new places using BOS.

**What need(s) does your project meet?**
At the global level, the project aims to address the problem of centralized ownership of websites, which leads to the loss of user control over their content, its use, and monetization, as well as the inability to influence the direction of the centralized project in any meaningful way.

At the developer level, we solve the issue of access to new, previously inaccessible audiences and solve their problems, which previously could only be handled by website owners.

**Are there any similar projects in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?**
As far as we know, there is no project solving similar problems within the NEAR ecosystem.

**If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**
A project that can be said to occupy a similar domain is Mask Network, but they only provide the functionality of the Twitter website and do not allow third-party developers to launch an expanded set of available applications.

## Future Plans

We just launched a new version of our extension that uses NEAR BOS instead of predefined elements to define the UI. Since our platform is community and developer-oriented, our main focus at the moment is onboarding existing projects to use the technology, allowing them to bring their functionality to places where it wasn't possible before. We are currently in talks with several projects in the NEAR ecosystem, but since the project and BOS we are using chain agnostic we are also looking to attract projects mainly focused on social networks in other networks.
We are also working closely with Learn Near Club and will be running a series of beta tests on all released apps.
Our goal is to create a tool for managing Mutations based on DAO, which defines the list of applications available to users and the principles of revenue sharing between all participants in the process. At this stage, we want to present the project to the communities. Having launched and tested this tool we plan to launch tokenomics.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Mintbase Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

We learned about the grant program from Luís Freitas when we participated in the Encode x Near Horizon accelerator. 

During the existence of the project, we have received and absorbed several R&D grants from ETHSwarm and NEAR Foundation totaling 80K USD. In the last three months, we also won 26К USD in hackathons and were granted 15k USD from NEAR Grassroots Initiative
